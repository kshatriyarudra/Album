# Album

=> Steps needed to complete this project:

1. Pre-requirement of html, css and javascript because this project is fully based upon this.

2. HTML-Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.

3. CSS- CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files, so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.
  Provide more attributes. CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.
 
4. Javascript-An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

5. Using html divide the screen in three parts:
   
   a. Album-menu- All the icons should be present here like https://github.com/kshatriyarudra/Album/blob/main/Album%20menu.png .
   
   b. Slide list- All the slide should be present here like https://github.com/kshatriyarudra/Album/blob/main/Slide%20list.png .
   
   c. Slide view- Details of slide and view of slide should be present in this section like https://github.com/kshatriyarudra/Album/blob/main/Slide%20view.png .
   
6. After html let's discuss about javascript:

   a. We have to select all the selector by querySelector then after initialise variable's, Adding eventlistener to the required query selector.
   
   b. After the above steps, use functions for add album, delete album, add slide, edit slide etc. We need to store our data to the local storage and retrieve data           when the program is reloaded.
7. After javascript let's discuss about css:

   a. Used of css was to build the page in attractive by using: i. font-weight ii. border-radius iii. padding iv. margin v. transform vi. display vii. background-           color viii. text-decoration ix. border x. cursor: pointer etc.
   
   b. For use of tags, we have to take care so that right things were being selected like as '#' was used for id, '.' was used for class etc.
