# Guess-The-Number-BASIC PROJECT
In this project I am playing with only one important function i.e.randint, which belongs to random libriary.
1.Taking input integer and then generate random integer in between these two numbers.
2.Taking guessing number as a input from player.
3.Compare both random integer and players input and few conditions raise.
